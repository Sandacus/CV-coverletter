# LaTeX resume template

This is the template I use for my own resume. I've compiled it with elements from several templates, including:

1. [Carmine Spagnuolo's Twenty Seconds Curriculum Vitae](https://github.com/spagnuolocarmine/TwentySecondsCurriculumVitae-LaTex)
2. [Carmine Benedetto's Smart Fancy LaTeX CV](https://github.com/neoben/smart-fancy-latex-cv)
3. [Adrien Friggeri's Fancy CV](https://www.sharelatex.com/templates/52fb8c1f33621a613683ecad)
4. [Harshavardhan Gadgil](http://github.com/opensorcerer/Data-Engineer-Resume-LaTeX)
## Installating pre-requisites (Windows)

1. Install [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/howto/install-miktex), a TeX distribution for Windows that includes a large number of major packages.

2. Install an editor to edit and compile LaTeX documents. I recommend [TeXstudio](http://www.texstudio.org/) or [Texmaker](http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/).

Once both the distribution and editor are installed, clone this repository using `git clone` and open the template.tex file in your editor. You're good to go!
